# Claude Token Tracker Chrome Extension

This directory contains the source code and assets for the upcoming
**Claude Token Tracker** browser extension. The extension is designed to provide
real‑time token usage statistics when interacting with Claude.ai, with a focus
on privacy, professional UI and extensibility.

## Development Notes

* **TypeScript** – Source files are written in TypeScript. Use a bundler like
  esbuild or Rollup to compile into the `dist/` directory referenced in
  `manifest.json`.
* **Web Worker** – Heavy processing (character counting, token estimation) is
  delegated to a Web Worker (`workers/tokenProcessor.ts`) to keep the UI
  responsive.
* **Storage** – Configuration and round data are stored via
  `chrome.storage.local`. Avoid external network requests; all data must remain
  local【554317721661585†L103-L118】.
* **UI** – The popup and options pages are built with vanilla HTML/CSS and
  minimal JS. They can be enhanced with a framework later.
* **Build** – A simple build script should compile TypeScript, copy static
  assets (HTML/CSS/icons) into `dist/` and output the finished extension.
* **Future** – Integrate with the Claude API for exact token counts, add
  auto‑tuning and additional export formats as described in the development plan.
